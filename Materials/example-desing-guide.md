# 🎨 **Company Design Guide**

This guide explains how to use the **three primary colours** and **four supporting colours** throughout your digital and printed materials. The purpose is to ensure **consistent branding**, **good accessibility**, and **a clear visual hierarchy** across all interfaces.

---

# ⭐ **1. Primary Colours**

These are the core identity colours. They should appear on every branded page or application.

---

## 🔴 **1.1 Primary Accent — #e10e49**

**Usage:**

* Key call-to-action buttons (CTAs)
* Active navigation states
* Interactive elements (links, toggles, highlights)
* Badges and labels requiring strong emphasis
* Visual anchors that guide the user’s attention

**Why it’s important:**
This colour carries the emotional weight of the brand. It communicates energy, direction, and a clear point of focus.

**Do:**

* Use for elements that require immediate visibility.
* Combine with white (#ffffff) for maximum accessibility.

**Avoid:**

* Using it excessively in large background areas.
* Using it for passive UI elements.

---

## ⚪ **1.2 Primary Light — #ffffff**

**Usage:**

* Main text colour on dark backgrounds
* Icons, borders, and small highlights
* Form elements (labels, placeholders, input borders)
* Dividers, table headers, and minimalistic accents

**Why it’s important:**
White is the readability anchor of the system. It ensures contrast, clarity, and visual balance in a dark UI.

**Do:**

* Use for body text, headlines, UI labels, and icons.
* Create contrast against the dark base (#1e1e1e).

**Avoid:**

* Using white for large solid blocks unless specifically needed for contrast sections.

## ⚫ **1.3 Primary Dark — #1e1e1e**

**Usage:**

* Main background colour
* Header and footer background
* Card backgrounds and layout containers
* UI surfaces that require depth and neutrality

**Why it’s important:**
This is the structural foundation of the visual identity. The dark tone creates a strong contrast that makes the accent colours vibrant.

**Do:**

* Use as the default background for pages, shells, and components.
* Layer slightly lighter greys (e.g., #2a2a2a) to create depth.

**Avoid:**

* Using dark text on this colour (always use white or very light greys).
