# Task I: Build a Rental Business Landing Page

> [!NOTE]
> The material was created with the help of ChatGPT and Copilot.

## 🎯  Objective

* Create a **landing page** for a fictional company that **rents something** — for example: **cars, apartments, drones, cameras, e-bikes, kayaks, or tools**.
* You decide what the company rents, how it looks, and what message it communicates.
* This page represents the **public face of the company** — it is **not a booking page**. Instead, it **introduces the company**, **shows what is available**, and **invites visitors to learn more or visit the rental catalog**.

## 💡What is a Landing Page?

**Landing page** is a focused introduction page that aims to **inform and attract** visitors. It highlights what the company offers and why it’s valuable — often serving as the first impression of a brand.

🚀 **A good landing page:**

✅ Clearly explains **what the business does** and **who it serves**  
✅ Uses appealing visuals (e.g. photos, icons, short videos)  
✅ Has a clear and consistent **visual identity** (colors, fonts, layout)  
✅ Is easy to read and **works well on all screen sizes**  
✅ Loads quickly and follows good accessibility practices  

❌ **A poor landing page:**

🚫 Feels cluttered or inconsistent in design  
🚫 Uses generic stock images that don’t match the offer  
🚫 Has unclear or missing structure (no clear sections or headlines)  
🚫 Breaks on small screens or loads slowly  
🚫 Lacks meaningful information about the company or services

## 🧠 Learning Goals

After completing this task, you will be able to:

* Design a **visually appealing** and **responsive** landing page
* Present content clearly and logically using **semantic HTML**
* Apply **CSS layout techniques** (flexbox, grid, responsive breakpoints)
* Create a **consistent color theme and typography system**
* Integrate multimedia elements (e.g. images, icons, videos) effectively

## ⚙️ Steps

### 1️⃣ Choose Your Rental Concept

Select what your company rents — for example:

* **Car rental**  
* **apartment rental**
* **camera rental**
* **drone rental**  
* **bike rental**
* **tool rental**
* etc.

Write a short tagline or slogan that communicates your company’s main value proposition.

> Example: “Fly higher with SkyRent — drones for every adventure.”

### 2️⃣ Plan Your Layout and Content

Your page should include **clear sections** such as:

* **Hero section:** A main image or video with a short, catchy headline
* **About section:** A few sentences introducing your company
* **Product highlights:** Photos or cards showing examples of rental items
* **Features/Benefits:** What makes your company unique
* **Call-to-Action area:** (e.g. “See available rentals” or “Contact us”) — no form required
* **Footer:** Contact info, links, or social media icons

You may design your own structure, but it must look **professional, clean, and well balanced**.

### 3️⃣ Use Semantic HTML

Use proper structure and elements:
* `<header>`
* `<main>`
* `<section>`
* `<article>`
* `<figure>`
* `<footer>`
* etc.

Follow correct heading levels (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`...).

---

### 4️⃣ Styling (CSS or Tailwind)

* Choose your **own color palette and font combination**
* Make the layout **responsive** for both desktop and mobile
* Use spacing, contrast, and alignment carefully
* Use **CSS Grid** or **Flexbox** for layout consistency

---

### 5️⃣ Media Integration

Include at least:

* **one or more high-quality images** (can be created using AI)
* Optionally: a short **introductory video** or animation
* Make sure media is **optimized** for web use

---

### 6️⃣ Accessibility and Validation

* Provide `alt` text for all images
* Maintain color contrast for readability
* Validate HTML using the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
* Ensure text and links are clear and easy to read
